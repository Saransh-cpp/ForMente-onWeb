      <h2>About ForMentee</h2>
      <p>ForMente is a personal diary application that allows users to write about their thoughts and feelings on a daily basis. The texts written by users are securely stored in a database, and users can access them at any time. The main goal of ForMente is to help users understand and manage their emotions by using natural language processing to analyze their written texts in real-time.</p>
      <p>The application recognizes that the first person someone usually talks to about their mental health is themselves, but this self-reflection can sometimes lead to self-doubt and overthinking. ForMente aims to address this by providing users with insights into their emotions through the power of natural language processing. By analyzing the texts written by users, the application provides real-time feedback on how users may be feeling, helping them gain a better understanding of their emotions.</p>
