      <h2>About ForMente</h2>
      <p>ForMente is a personal diary application that allows users to write about their thoughts and feelings on a daily basis.

The main goal of ForMente is to help users understand and manage their emotions by using natural language processing to analyze their written texts in real-time.</p>
